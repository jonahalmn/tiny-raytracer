# Absolutely useless

This project is a WebGL raytracer, for now it can only raytrace 3 spheres and cast shadow on a plane, yes nobody needs this.

The raytracer is mainly written in fragment shader.

It don't really work but you can see demo [here](https://cheumanduseless.netlify.com/)

#### To do:

- Improve this absolutely ugly render
- Several materials render
- Soft shadows
- Multiples lights
- Improve intersections between objects
- Many many more...

#### How to run

Just clone and execute yarn && yarn start.
